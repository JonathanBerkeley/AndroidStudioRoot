When creating a Fragment, you inflate the layout in the onCreateView() method. When creating an Activity, you inflate the layout in onCreate().
When inflating the layout for either a Fragment or an Activity, you can reference the layout as R.layout.layoutname.

You can use a Fragment in more than one Activity.
One Activity can have multiple fragments.
