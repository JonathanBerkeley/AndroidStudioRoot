    \n\nThis is a testing paragraph.
    \nMy name is Jonathan and I am learning to code apps.
    \nThis is my first time using the Kotlin language.
    \n\nI don\'t have anything to write here,
    \nit\'s merely to take up space for testing the scroll view.
    \nIf you are reading this then that\'s strange,
    \nthis text was not intended for anyone to read.
    \n\nThis is the final paragraph.
    \nYet more space being filled with meaningless text.
    \nI could have used lorem ipsum for this, I guess.
    \nSomething inspired me to write this instead.
    \n\nOkay goodbye!\n\n</string>
